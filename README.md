- Notice boards
- Separate attendance systems
- Disconnected portals
- Personal messages between students and staff
**Seshadripuram One** brings all of these academic workflows into a single, secure platform.
 
> ### One app. One identity. One academic ecosystem.

## 🔐 Authentication Architecture
 
Security is a core principle of Seshadripuram One. Users **do not** freely choose whether they are a student or teacher — the backend determines identity and role from the authoritative college records.
 
### Account Activation
 
```text
User
 │
 │ College / Institution ID
 ▼
Backend
 │
 │ Search authoritative database
 ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Student / Teacher record │
└────────────┬─────────────┘
             │
             │ Valid + Active
             ▼
        OTP Request
             │
             ▼
      Verified Contact
             │
             ▼
        Enter OTP
             │
             ▼
      OTP Verification
             │
             ▼
     Activation Grant
             │
             ▼
       Set Password
             │
             ▼
       Account Active
```
 
### Subsequent Login
 
```text
College ID + Password
          │
          ▼
       Backend
          │
          ▼
     Authentication
          │
          ▼
   Access JWT + Refresh
          │
          ▼
     Authenticated App
```

## 👥 Role-Based Access Control
 
Seshadripuram One enforces **server-side** role authorization — the client never decides permissions.
 
<details open>
<summary><b>👨‍🎓 Student</b></summary>
Students will eventually be able to access:
 
- Announcements & class updates
- Timetable
- Attendance (overall & subject-wise) and absence history
- Internal examination marks, SIM examination marks, project marks
- Assignments & assignment attachments
- Notes & study materials
- Teacher updates
Students **cannot** modify protected academic information.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>👨‍🏫 Teacher</b></summary>
Teachers will eventually be able to:
 
- Publish announcements & class updates
- Upload notes and academic materials
- Create assignments and upload attachments
- Enter and update attendance
- Enter and update internal marks, SIM examination marks, project marks
- Communicate academic information
Teacher permissions are enforced entirely by the backend.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>👑 Administrator</b></summary>
Administrators will manage controlled institutional data such as:
 
- Students, teachers, departments, subjects, sections
- Academic years and semesters
- Initial data imports
Admin registration is **not** publicly available.
</details>
---
 
## 🛡️ Security Principles
 
The Flutter application is treated as an **untrusted client**. The backend never blindly trusts values supplied by the app — it independently determines:
 
- User identity
- Role
- Institution ID
- Department & section
- Permissions
- Resource ownership
This design prevents attacks such as:
 
```text
Student → Change role → Teacher                    ❌
Student → Modify another student's marks            ❌
Student → Modify attendance                          ❌
User    → Activate unknown institution ID            ❌
```
 
Authorization is enforced on the backend rather than relying on Flutter navigation guards.
 
---
 
## 🔑 OTP Security
 
- Cryptographically secure OTP generation
- Hashed OTP storage
- Expiration & one-time use
- Verification attempt limits
- OTP invalidation after use
- Request rate limiting
- Development-only OTP delivery abstraction (production SMS/email provider to be connected later)
> OTP values are never intended to be stored in the Flutter application.
 
---
 
## 🗄️ Database
 
Built on **Turso + libSQL + Drizzle ORM**, with a schema covering:
 
`Users` · `Students` · `Teachers` · `Departments` · `Courses` · `Subjects` · `Academic Years` · `Semesters` · `Sections` · `Enrollments` · `Timetable` · `Attendance` · `Attendance Records` · `Announcements` · `Notes` · `Assignments` · `Assignment Submissions` · `Internal Marks` · `SIM Examination Marks` · `Project Marks` · `Audit Logs` · `Authentication Sessions` · `Activation Grants`
 
The schema will continue to evolve as each academic feature is implemented.

## 🔌 Authentication API
 
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/request-activation` | Start account activation |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/verify-otp` | Verify OTP |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/set-password` | Complete activation |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/refresh` | Refresh session |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/logout` | End session |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/me` | Get authenticated user |
| `POST` | `/api/academic/attendance` | Authorization boundary |
 
> The academic attendance endpoint is currently an authorization foundation and is intentionally not yet a complete attendance feature.
 
---
 
## 🌎 Deployment Architecture
 
The frontend and backend are designed to deploy independently:
 
```text
Flutter App
     │
     │ API_BASE_URL
     ▼
Cloud Backend
     │
     ▼
Turso Database
```
 
The project does **not** assume ownership of a custom domain — the backend can initially use a platform-provided deployment URL:
 
```env
API_BASE_URL=https://<deployed-backend-url>
```
 
A custom domain can be introduced later without changing the application architecture.
 
---
 
## 🔐 Environment Configuration
 
Backend configuration is provided through environment variables:
 
```env
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_ISSUER=
JWT_AUDIENCE=
OTP_PROVIDER=
CORS_ORIGINS=
```
 
A template is provided at `backend/.env.example`.
 
> ⚠️ **Real credentials must never be committed to GitHub.**
 
---
 
## 🧪 Testing
 
**Backend**
 
```bash
cd backend
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
```
 
**Flutter**
 
```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```
 
Current Phase 3 verification covers:
 
- Unknown institution IDs
- Student & teacher role resolution
- OTP validation, expiration, reuse prevention, attempt limits
- Authentication & authorization boundaries
- JWT/session behavior
- Flutter authentication repository
---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations
 
Seshadripuram One is **not yet production-ready**. The following still require external configuration or future development:
 
- Production Turso database & credentials
- SMS/email OTP provider
- Backend cloud deployment
- Production application signing
- Complete academic modules
- Admin data import workflow
- Production monitoring
- Final security hardening
The current implementation intentionally focuses on building a secure foundation before implementing the complete academic platform.
 
---
 
## 🔒 Security
 
Security issues should **not** be publicly discussed through GitHub issues. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately to the project maintainer rather than publishing exploit details publicly.
 
Never commit the following to the repository:
 
- Database credentials
- JWT secrets
- OTP provider credentials
- API keys
- Personal student or teacher information
---
 
## 🤝 Development Philosophy
 
Seshadripuram One is being developed incrementally, prioritizing:
 
> **Security → Architecture → Testing → Features → Production**
 
rather than building a large UI first and adding security afterward. The goal is a platform that can eventually handle real institutional data safely and reliably.
